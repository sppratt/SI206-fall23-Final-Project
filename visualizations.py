# select data from the database and perform calculations and visualize the results

#plot locations on map (lat vs long)
#plot temp vs quality of life (cross weather and quality databases)
#temp vs rank (city id)
#population vs. quality of life, safety, traffic, cost

# quality of life index per capita by dividing the quality of life by population (join quality and population)
# can do that with all of the indexes in quality table
